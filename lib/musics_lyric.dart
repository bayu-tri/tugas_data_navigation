        "Go ahead and park after dark\nFallen star, I'm your one call away\nMotel halls, neon walls\nWhen night falls, I am your escape\nWhen you lay alone, I ache\nSomething I wanted to feel\nIf you've been waiting for fallin' in love\nBabe, you don't have to wait on me\n'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above\nBut an angel ain't what I need\nNot anyone, you're the one\nMore than fun, you're the sanctuary\n'Cause what you want is what I want\nSincerity\nSouls that dream alone lie awake\nI'll give you something so real\nIf you've been waiting for fallin' in love\nBabe, you don't have to wait on me\n'Cause I've been aiming for Heaven above\nBut an angel ain't what I need\nPull me oh so close\n'Cause you never know\nJust how long our lives will be\nIf you've been waiting for fallin' in love\nBabe, you don't have to wait on me\n'Cause I've been aiming for Heaven above\nBut an angel ain't what I need",

Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it? Oh\nGuess there is something, and there is nothing\nThere is nothing in between\nAnd in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer\nWatching over me, he's singing\nShe's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy\nHe's singing, She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook\nBaby, I am a wreck when I'm without you\nI need you here to stay\nI broke all my bones that day I found you\nCrying at the lake\nWas it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh\nAnd if I could take it all back\nI swear that I would pull you from the tide",
